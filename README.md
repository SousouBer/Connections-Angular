# About the application - Connections

Application represents the platform to allow users to communicate via public text messages. Before starting to use the service a guest must register and sign in. Authorized user can see vertically divided main page, where left side is a list of public group and right side is a list of people including personal conversations. Each user can create own public group and broadcast messages there or use existing group along with other participants. These messages are then sent to the API. Personal information can be viewed on a special profile page, where it can be immediately edited. The application is by far the most complex one I have made yet. It uses all the core parts of Angular, Http, Routing, guards, forms and validations, authentication, RxJs and NgRx. Source code can be seen in the branch week-1.
I've built the project when I enrolled in the training of Rs School - Angular course, which was a great experience for me and I have learned much about Angular.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
